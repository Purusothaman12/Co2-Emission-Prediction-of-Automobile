In this project, I dove into a Canada-based dataset to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles using the power of machine learning. 🇨🇦🔍

📈 With environmental concerns growing, understanding and mitigating the impact of vehicles on CO2 emissions is crucial. That's where this project comes in—to predict and gain insights into CO2 emissions from automobiles using data-driven approaches.

📊💡 The dataset I used is derived from Canada's context, making it even more relevant to our local needs. By applying machine learning techniques, I've created a predictive model that can estimate CO2 emissions based on vehicle attributes, fuel types, and driving conditions.

🚗💨 The results are promising! My model achieved impressive accuracy in predicting CO2 emissions from automobiles. It's a significant step towards understanding the factors influencing emissions and implementing strategies for a greener future.

💼 But I didn't stop there. I wanted this project to make a real impact, so I made sure the insights are accessible to everyone. I developed an easy-to-use interface using Streamlit, so businesses and individuals alike can explore the CO2 predictions and contribute to a cleaner environment.

🛣️🌿 By combining my passion for automobiles with the power of data science, I'm excited to be part of the solution for a more sustainable future. And this project is just the beginning! 🌟
