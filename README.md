In this project, I dove into a Canada-based dataset to predict CO2 emissions from vehicles using the power of machine learning. 🇨🇦🔍

📈 With environmental concerns growing, understanding and mitigating the impact of vehicles on CO2 emissions is crucial. That's where this project comes in—to predict and gain insights into CO2 emissions from automobiles using data-driven approaches.

📊💡 The dataset I used is derived from Canada's context, making it even more relevant to our local needs. By applying machine learning techniques, I've created a predictive model that can estimate CO2 emissions based on vehicle attributes, fuel types, and driving conditions.

🚗💨 The results are promising! My model achieved impressive accuracy in predicting CO2 emissions from automobiles. It's a significant step towards understanding the factors influencing emissions and implementing strategies for a greener future.

💼 But I didn't stop there. I wanted this project to make a real impact, so I made sure the insights are accessible to everyone. I developed an easy-to-use interface using Streamlit, so businesses and individuals alike can explore the CO2 predictions and contribute to a cleaner environment.

🛣️🌿 By combining my passion for automobiles with the power of data science, I'm excited to be part of the solution for a more sustainable future. And this project is just the beginning! 🌟

Let's connect and chat about this exciting journey—I'd love to hear your thoughts and explore how technology can drive positive change. 🌐🚀

## Model Deployment

For this project, I've selected the CatBoost model for deployment due to its outstanding accuracy in predicting CO2 emissions from automobiles. CatBoost, a powerful gradient boosting library, has demonstrated exceptional performance on our dataset, resulting in accurate and reliable predictions.

The CatBoost model is trained on the preprocessed Canada-based dataset, utilizing features related to vehicle characteristics, fuel types, and driving conditions. Its ability to handle categorical features, coupled with its robust boosting techniques, contributes to its high accuracy.

To make the insights and predictions readily accessible, I've deployed the CatBoost model using Streamlit. This web application offers an intuitive interface that allows users to input relevant information and obtain CO2 emission predictions effortlessly. It's a user-friendly way to leverage the predictive capabilities of our model.

Feel free to explore the `model_deployment/` directory to find the necessary files and instructions to run the Streamlit application and experience the predictive power of the CatBoost model firsthand.

Let's drive toward a more sustainable future using data-driven solutions!
